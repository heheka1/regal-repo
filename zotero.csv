And there was no known solution to being stuck between the sexes. Laura Dillon did all she could on her own: she cut her hair, dressed in men's clothing, bound her breasts with a belt. But in a desperate bid to feel comfortable in her own skin, she experimented with breakthrough technologies that ultimately transformed the human body and revolutionized medicine. From upper-class orphan girl to Oxford lesbian, from post-surgery romance with Roberta Cowell (an early male-to-female) to self-imposed exile in India, Michael Dillon's incredible story reveals the struggles of early transsexuals and challenges conventional notions of what gender really means. Also includes information on Roberta Cowell, Christine Jorgensen, Institute for Sexual Science (Berlin), estrogen, testosterone, etc","2007","2025-03-21 20:24:55","2025-03-21 20:24:55","","","214","","","","","The first man-made man","","","","","Bloomsbury","New York, NY","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","HQ77.8.D55 K46 2007","","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/3659182","physical","Biography; Dillon, Michael; Gender identity; Gender reassignment surgery; Gender transition; Great Britain; Transsexuals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st U.S. ed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Later, she came out on a national stage, working with major organizations toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights. Then, within eighteen months, Chaz Bono became the most high-profile transgender person ever. Part One traces his decision to transition, beginning in his childhood--when he played on the boys' teams and wore boys' clothing whenever possible--and going through his painful, but ultimately joyful, coming out in his twenties, up to 2008, when, after the death of his father, drug addiction, and five years of sobriety, Chaz was finally ready to begin the process. In Part Two, he offers a record of the actual transition, a real-time diary as he navigates uncharted waters. Throughout the book, Chaz touches on themes of identity, gender, and sexuality; parents and children; and how harboring secrets shatters the soul.--From publisher description","2011","2025-03-21 20:24:17","2025-03-21 20:24:17","","","245","","","","","Transition","","","","","Dutton","New York","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","HQ77.8.B66 A3 2011","OCLC: 698363139","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/7166302","physical","Biography; Gender identity; Transgender people; United States; Female-to-male transsexuals; Bono, Chaz; Psychological aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"JH3VBSVP","book","2021","Glazebrook, Allison","Sexual labor in the Athenian courts","","978-1-4773-2440-0","","","","""Ancient Greek oratory has long been seen as a source for cultural and historical information, in this case on sexual labor, which is generally treated differently within ancient speeches than within other genres, such as comedy or philosophy. Oratory provides evidence of male and female sex laborers, the private ownership of sex slaves, Athenian brothels, sex traffickers (the majority of whom appear to have been female), the cost of sex, the use of contracts between sex laborers and clients, manumission practices for sex slaves, and even the sharing of a sex laborer between two clients (as either joint owners or through a contract for exclusive use). As opposed to the stereotypical witty, educated hetaira that appears in other Athenian literature, sex laborers as they appear in Athenian speeches are portrayed as potentially dangerous transgressors that threaten social on both male and female sex laborers found within. Each chapter focuses on a specific theme (such as desire, the household, or dangerous women) and uses that as a touchstone to examine the representations of prostitutes and sexuality within the speech. Although prostitution was legal in ancient Athens, it was often complicated by notions of gender and sex, citizenship, slavery and ownership, and other issues that become apparent in the speeches. The variety of ways in which prostitution was approached within oratory help reveal the complex cultural constructions around the activity. Glazebrook shows that the different ways in which sex laborers interact with each other and with society as a whole, as depicted in the speeches, reveal the complexity and diversity not only of sexual labor itself, but also of the attitudes, ambiguities, and anxieties that surrounded sexual labor in classical Athens""--","2021","2025-03-25 03:00:44","2025-03-25 03:00:44","","","246","","","","","","","","","","University of Texas Press","Austin, TX","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","HQ113 .G54 2021","OCLC: 1237650404","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/36139068","interlibrary","History; Prostitution; To 1500; Athens; Athens (Greece); Civilization; Civilization History; Greece; Greece Athens; Manners and customs; Social aspects; Social aspects History; Social life and customs History; Speeches, addresses, etc., Greek; To 146 B.C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
