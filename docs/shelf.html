            <h1>Digitally Catloging a Library Shelf</h1>
            <p>For class, I was tasked to picking a shelf in my college's library and recording
            the books I found into a program called zotero. I then used a website called Palladio
            to extract data from the books on the shelves.</p>

                <figcaption>The bookshelf I used. I picked this section of the library because
                it's close to where I usually study when I'm in the libarary.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>A Table of My Catalog</figcaption>
            <p>Along with catalogging the books I found on the library shelf, I went onto the library's website
                and looked up books that had similar ISBNs that were from other Penn State libraries. I also
                added some websites that also related to the topics of books I found. The topics that my shelf 
            discussed were gender and sexulality, primarily the discussion of transgender people. I also had a couple
            of entries that were about prostiution in ancient Greece.</p>

            <h2>Some Data I Was Able to Get</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="timeline.png" alt="Screen capture of a bar graph. The x axis of the graph 
                    has dates on it, the y axis is the number of books on 
                    my shelf that were published in that year." width="500" height="300"/>
  
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="timespan.png" alt="screen capture of a scatter plot showing the timespan
                    of each book being published"  width="500" height="300"/>
            </figure>
            <p>These graphs are interesting because the highest number of books I cataloged were published
            between 2005-2010. What makes that data even more fascinating is that there was rapant
            homophobia and transphobia during the early 2000s, so you wouldn't think a lot of
            queer books would be published then. That bigotry may be the exact reason why a lot of books were published
            then, though. It's also interesting that I didn't have any entries that were published
            between 1980-1995, which would have been at the height of the AIDs crisis. I wounder
            if that correlates with the lack of these types of books being put in libraries at this time.</p>
