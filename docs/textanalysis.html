        <h1>Analyizing Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover's Speech Patterns</h1>
        <p>FDR and Hoover were presidents who served around the same time, and they both faced the challenges that 
            came about with the Great Depression, but besides that, their legacy in American history couldn't be more different. This can be seen with the fact Hoover only served a single term as president,
        where as FDR would go on to serve three terms, being the only president to do so. Because of these facts, I thought it would be interesting to analyize 
        and compare the words and phrases they use in their speeches. To do this, I used text analysis tools like AntConc and Voyant
        to help me pick up any patterns that I see.</p>
        <h2>FDR</h2>
        <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the 32nd (1933-1945) president of the United States, and the longest serving presdient in the country's history.
          He got the United States Through the Great Depression, and World War II, and because of this,
          he is one of the most highly regarded presidents the country has had.
        </p>
        <h2>Herbert Hoover</h2>
        <p> Herbert Clark Hoover was the 31st (1929-1933) president of the United States. Most of the his presidentcy was dominated
            by the Great Depression, this crisis resulting in his popularity completely tanking. He was relunctant in using government intervention
            with the issue, which resulted in many seeing his efforts in fixing the Depression as lack luster.

            <h1>My Findings</h1>
          <h3>First, I compared the most frequent 3 ngram phrases for each president. </h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="newrngram.png" alt="picture of Roosevelt's 3 ngrams" width="600" >
           <figcaption>Roosevelt's most common ngram was <i>The United States</i> which isn't a shocking thing
               to hear a US president saying. Regardless of that fact, I think it also reveals his priorties as president,
               and also the polictial climate that he was inheriting. I will discuss more about his usuage of <i>United States</i>
               later on in my analysis.
           </figcaption> </figure>
           
                <figure>
                    <img src="hngram.png" alt="picture of Hoover's 3 ngrams" width="600" >
             <figcaption>I thought it was interesting that Hoover's top ngram was <i>The Federal Government</i>,
           but thinking about it, it makes sense. One of his biggest priorities as president was
             to prevent government oversight, and attempting to balance the country's deficit.</figcaption>

            <figure>
                <img src="KWICfed.png" alt="Picture of Hoover's KWIC with The Federal Government" width="600"/>
            </figure>
            <p>I was correct in my assumption of Hoover's usage of <i>The Federal Government</i>.
                When looking at the Key Word In Context (KWIC) of <i>The Federal Government</i>, he is mostly using it
                to discuss what he believes it role is towards the American people. Another trend that started to happen during this time
                was America started to become an isolationist country, where many felt the US needed to keep to itself and 
                prioritize internal affairs over anything else. Hoover's isolationist policies shine through in this KWIC where he 
                does not really talk about any other area except the US. This completely contrasts Roosevelt, which we will see later on.

                    <h2><i>The United States</i>, he said</h2>
                  <p>As I stated before, Roosevelt's most common phrase is <i>The United States</i>. Because this 
                  seems like a pretty typical statement for the country's president to say, I compared Roosevelt's usage
                  to Hoover's.</p>         
           <h3><i>The United States</i> and Hoover</h3>    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="hunitedstates.png" alt="image of Hoover's KWIC of The United States." width="600"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>It appears for Hoover, he mostly discuss The United States in relation to war reparations and
                    federal programs. Hoover was elected a few years after World War I, and during this time most of the countries that fought 
                    in it were in extreme debt. So, the US gave a lot of relief funds to these countries. I am assuming 
                    the federal programs he is discussing are ones to help improve the Great Depression.</p>

                        <h3><i>The United States</i> and Roosevelt</h3>    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="newrus.png" alt="imagine of Roosevelt's KWIC of The United States"  width="600" />
                <p>Roosevelt's uses the phrase <i>The United States</i> as a ralying tool. He brings up the hardships that
                the US is going through, whether he is talking about the Great Depression or WWII is unclear. He also uses it in relation 
                to rallying together to help other countries. An example of this is when he brings up the North African 
                Campaign that happened in WWII where the US helped out the United Kingdom to fight off Italy. That is what made him such 
                an affective leader. He was able to convince the country to rally together, and this enable the nation 
                to get through events like the Great Depression and WWII. Hoover's rhetoric lacks this key element, and is obviously
                a factor into why he only ran a single presidental term.</p>
