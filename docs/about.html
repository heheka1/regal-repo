            <h2>Some of my goals</h2>
            
            <p>I am currently attending Penn State Behrend for a BA in history and a minor in Digital Media. 
                I hope become a museum curator when I am out of college. 
                The time period I would like to focus my research on is the 19th century.
                I also hope the skills I learn in DIGIT can help me with the preservation of historical information, and the spreading of said information as well.
            </p>
       <p>I also like to write, and I have been working on a novel for about four years now. I hope to publish it in the next few years</p>
            <p>For the past few years, I've been learning how to make jewelry. 
                I mostly make bracelets and earrings, but I also do rings and necklaces as well.
            I have started to dabble in resin jewelry too. 
            I have started to go to different craft shows and I hope to do it more often. </p>
